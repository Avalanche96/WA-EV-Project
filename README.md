# WA-EV-Project
A data analysis project centered around the electric vehicle--or EV--population of Washington State. The accompanying visualization created from the provided datasets can be found here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/david.m.1959/viz/WA_EV_Project/WashingtonStateElectricVehiclePopulationReport?publish=yes


This project's scope was largely exploratory in nature utilizing both postgreSQL and Jupyter Notebooks. As the project progressed I wanted to focus on a few key points that emerged: First, there was the relatively straightforward question of what the most popular make and model were according to the dataset. Then I wanted to look at how the prices of electric vehicles had changed over time as well as how the electric ranges of these vehicles had changed over time, seeing as those are the major factors consumers consider when they go shopping for a new car.  I also wanted to look into how each county in Washington state was faring when it came to the adoption of electric vehicles and subsequently compare those numbers against the state's average rate of EV adoption. Additionally, since EVs tend to have an easier time gaining a foothold in built up urban centers, it seemed only sensible to see if that trend would prevail here as well.  Another question that surfaced that seemed worthy of analysis was why there was a relative lack of electric vehicles that met the requirements for what was potentially a tax incentive.
